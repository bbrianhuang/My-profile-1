Quick description of myself and my experience with the Yearup program. 



**Who am I?**

My name is Devan Jovan Henderson, I go by DJ. I am currently a newly Google certified project manager. I am excited to find my first professional home and start my career. I really enjoy working in a team setting but I do not mind time to myself. I am a open book and would love to network. Below you will find a link to my Linkedin. I look forward to meeting you!
